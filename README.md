### About Me

Gerhard has been implementing traditional BI and data warehouse solutions based on the Microsoft Data Platform for over 15 years with the personal focus on analytical databases. With the rise of "Cloud" and "Big Data" over the last years he also shifted his interests towards Microsoft Azure and Hadoop/Spark. A lot of his experience in BI and DWH he can still apply in this "new world" and use it to fight the masses of data he frequently encounters at his customers. Ever since he was working very close with the community for which he was got his MVP award in July 2016.

I am working at [paiqo GmbH](https://paiqo.com) where we dedicated our efforts on building Analticaly Platforms and AI solutions on the Microsoft Azure Platform for and together with our customers all around the world. Whenever I encounter interesting stuff I usually blog about it at [blog.gbrueckl.at](https://blog.gbrueckl.at). 

My current focus here on github is building VSCode extensions for the tools I use an a daily basis which are foremost [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview) and [Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview) but also [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/).
